<!-- Day 1 -->
<section class="day-section" id="day1">
  <h3>Day 1 — Understanding Ingredients</h3>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Recognize the qualities of primary ingredients.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Study vegetables: freshness, seasonality, and flavor intensity.</li>
    <li>Understand proteins: texture, fat content, and cooking behavior.</li>
    <li>Identify starches: rice, potatoes, pasta — how they behave when cooked.</li>
    <li>Note ingredients’ natural flavors and ideal pairings.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="exercise">
    <strong>Exercise:</strong> Taste a raw vegetable, then cook it using two different methods. Record flavor, texture, and aroma changes.
  </div>
  <div class="exercise">
    <strong>Mini Challenge:</strong> Select one protein and cook it using two techniques. Compare and document.
  </div>

<!-- Day 2 -->
<section class="day-section" id="day2">
  <h3>Day 2 — Advanced Flavor Profiling</h3>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Analyze ingredients’ flavor components in detail.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Smell, taste, and note sweet, salty, acidic, bitter, and umami elements.</li>
    <li>Experiment with small combinations to see complementary or contrasting effects.</li>
    <li>Learn to detect dominant vs supporting flavors.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Sauté, roast, steam, poach, braise — understand which foods benefit from each.</li>
    <li>Observe Maillard reactions, caramelization, and moisture retention.</li>
    <li>Take notes on timing, temperature, and results.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="exercise">
    <strong>Exercise:</strong> Cook one vegetable and one protein using three different methods. Record flavor and texture differences.

  <h3>Day 4 — Early Dish Composition</h3>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Learn how to structure a simple composed dish.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose a base (starch, grain, or vegetable), main ingredient, and flavor enhancer.</li>
    <li>Consider textures, flavors, and colors while combining components.</li>
    <li>Practice mise en place for multiple elements at once.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Day 5 -->
<section class="day-section" id="day5">
  <h3>Day 5 — Seasoning & Finishing Techniques</h3>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Apply advanced seasoning and finishing touches.</p>

    <li>Use acids, fats, and aromatics to elevate flavors.</li>
    <li>Learn simple garnishes that enhance visual appeal and taste.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="exercise">
