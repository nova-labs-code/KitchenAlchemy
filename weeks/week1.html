  <h3>Day 1 — The Four Forces of Flavor</h3>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Identify salt, fat, acid, and heat in foods.</p>
  <p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Taste a plain boiled potato. Add salt gradually, noting changes. Try kosher, sea, and table salts.</li>
    <li><strong>Fat:</strong> Cook tomato or zucchini in butter vs olive oil vs plain. Observe texture, flavor, and mouthfeel.</li>
    <li><strong>Acid:</strong> Add lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt to the same ingredient. Notice how it brightens flavors.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat:</strong> Roast vs steam vs sauté a vegetable. Observe flavor, color, and aroma changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="exercise">
    <strong>Exercise:</strong> Taste 4 versions of one vegetable: plain, salted, fat-added, acid-added. Record notes in a flavor journal.
  </div>
  <div class="exercise">
    <strong>Mini Challenge:</strong> Try pairing two of the forces together (e.g., fat + acid) and note what flavor emerges.

  <h3>Day 2 — Layering Seasoning</h3>

    <li>Notice how timing changes depth and complexity.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="exercise">

  </div>
  <div class="exercise">
    <strong>Mini Challenge:</strong> Add a small pinch of acid at the end and see how it changes the dish’s brightness.
  </div>
  <div class="exercise">
    <strong>Journaling:</strong> Record what you noticed from timing seasoning at different stages.
